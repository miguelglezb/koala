Running PyKOALA in a Python virtual environment
===============================================

What is a virtual environment?
------------------------------

A Python virtual environment is an isolated setup containing a specific Python interpreter and its dependencies, separate from the systemâ€™s global Python setup. It enables projects to have their own set of dependencies without interfering with other projects or the system-wide Python installation.
**It enables projects to have their own set of dependencies without interfering with other projects or the system-wide Python installation**. Python environments, like virtual environments or Docker, offer these key benefits:

1. **Isolation**: Keeps dependencies separate, avoiding conflicts.
2. **Dependency Management**: Easily manage dependencies for each project.
3. **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent environments for development and deployment.
4. **Portability**: Makes projects easily shareable and deployable on different systems.
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Allows experimentation with different package versions.
6. **Security**: Enhances security by limiting system-level access.

In essence, they provide a structured and controlled way to manage dependencies, leading to more reliable projects.


Installation
------------

From the terminal, enter in the PyKOALA directory and type:

::

    python3 -m venv venv_koala

This will create named ``venv_koala`` with the neccesary files to activate and use the environmet. To activate it, use:

::

    source venv_koala/bin/activate

Then install all required packages with:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt ; pip install . 

The second command will also install PyKOALA in the virtual environment.
