Running Pykoala in a python virtual environment
***********************************************

A Python virtual environment is an isolated environment that contains a specific Python interpreter and its dependencies, separate from the system's global Python environment. It enables projects to have their own set of dependencies without interfering with other projects or the system-wide Python installation. Python environments, like virtual environments or Docker, offer these key benefits:

* **Isolation**: Keeps dependencies separate, avoiding conflicts.
   
* **Dependency Management**: Easily manage dependencies for each project.

* **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent environments for development and deployment.

* **Portability**: Makes projects easily shareable and deployable on different systems.

* **Conflict Resolution**: Allows experimentation with different package versions.

* **Security**: Enhances security by limiting system-level access.
